		this area with accessible terrain, and make it possible to lay ski slopes 
		with a vertical drop of 900-1000 m. In this regard, since 1954, the Chimbulak 
		ski sports base began to operate here. The length of the track for sports 
		descent from the Talgar Pass is 3,500 m, giant slalom 1,500 m, average width 
		25 m, slope 11–29 °. Such parameters allow athletes to develop maximum speeds 
		along its entire length.</p>
