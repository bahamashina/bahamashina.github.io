		<h3 align="center">About Waterfall</h3>
		<p>Butakovsky Falls is the largest waterfall located near Almaty. There are two waterfalls in the Butakovsky Gorge - 
		Nizhny (Bolshoi) and Upper. Ascent to the waterfall begins at an altitude of 1787 m above sea level. After walking 
		along a dirt road among beautiful fir trees, we approach the Extreme base. Having passed through its territory, we
		see a pointer on the left and go down to the spring. The waterfall is formed by a small stream, which falls almost 
		vertically down along the cliff.</p>
