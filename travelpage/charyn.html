		<p>One of the most beautiful places in Kazakhstan - the Charyn Canyon - is located in the spurs of the Tien Shan, two hundred kilometers from Almaty.
		Charyn Canyon is located in the Charyn National Park and is composed of sedimentary rocks, whose age is about 12 million years.
		Nature has created a unique landscape in the desert plain, which attracts not only domestic but also foreign tourists.
		The canyon is 154 km long along the Charyn River, and the height of the steep mountains reaches 150-300 meters. 
		In the Charyn Canyon is the famous Ashen Grove, where rare Sogdian ash grows.</p>
